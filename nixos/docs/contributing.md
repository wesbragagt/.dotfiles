# Contributing to Documentation

When adding new documentation to the `docs/` folder, follow this format:

## Document Structure

Each documentation file should contain:

1. **Problem/solution** - 1-2 sentences explaining what the issue is and how it was solved
2. **Code example** (if applicable) - Working code that demonstrates the solution
3. **Source reference** - URL link to where the solution was found or validated

## Example Format

```markdown
# Short descriptive title

Brief 1-2 sentence description of the problem and solution.

```nix
# Working code example
example = "value";
```

Src: https://source-url.com
```

## Guidelines

- Keep descriptions concise and actionable
- Code examples should be copy-pasteable and tested
- Always include source URLs for future reference
- Use descriptive filenames with hyphens (e.g., `hyprland-gestures.md`)
