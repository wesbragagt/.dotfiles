# Pull Request Guidelines

## Git Workflow

### 1. Add Changes
```bash
# Stage specific files
git add <filename>

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Stage all tracked files (excludes new files)
git add -u
```

### 2. Commit Changes
```bash
# Commit with message
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication system"

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "fix: resolve database connection timeout

- Increase connection timeout from 5s to 30s
- Add retry logic for failed connections
- Update error handling for better debugging"
```

#### Commit Message Convention
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes  
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

### 3. Push to Remote Branch
```bash
# Push current branch to origin (creates remote branch if it doesn't exist)
git push origin HEAD

# Alternative: Push specific branch
git push origin <branch-name>
```

**Important:** Always push to `origin HEAD` (your current branch), never directly to `main` or `master`.

### 4. Create Pull Request
```bash
# Create PR with title and body
gh pr create --title "feat: implement user dashboard" --body "Detailed description of changes"

# Create PR interactively (prompts for title/body)
gh pr create

# Create PR with template
gh pr create --title "feat: implement user dashboard" --body-file pr-template.md
```

## Pull Request Template

Use this template structure for consistent, informative PRs:

```markdown
## Description

This PR significantly improves user productivity by reducing rate card discovery time from minutes to seconds. Warehouse managers can now make faster pricing decisions through advanced filtering capabilities and modern UI components.

**Key Benefits:**
- 50% faster rate card discovery through debounced search and multi-filter support
- Streamlined warehouse and date range filtering for improved decision-making
- Modern, consistent UI components for better user experience

## Problem

Users experienced friction managing rate cards across multiple warehouses and time periods. The existing interface required manual scrolling through hundreds of entries, leading to 3-5 minutes per search and inconsistent user experience with mixed component libraries.

## Changes

- Migrated RateCardsTable from Ant Design to shadcn/ui data-table component
- Added comprehensive filtering: search, warehouse dropdown, and date range pickers
- Implemented stackable filters with visual indicators and clear buttons
- Created filter utilities with 27 unit tests and URL persistence support
- Updated page layout with unified Card design and optimized spacing
```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Complete workflow for a new feature
git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user dashboard with filtering"
git push origin HEAD
gh pr create --title "feat: implement user dashboard" --body "Add comprehensive user dashboard with advanced filtering capabilities"

# Quick fix workflow

git push origin HEAD
gh pr create
```

## Best Practices

1. **Branch Naming**: Use descriptive names like `feat/user-auth`, `fix/database-timeout`, `docs/api-guide`
2. **Commit Often**: Make small, focused commits with clear messages
3. **Review Before Push**: Always review your changes before pushing
4. **Test Locally**: Ensure tests pass before creating PR
5. **Link Issues**: Reference related issues in PR description using `#issue-number`
6. **Request Reviews**: Tag relevant team members for review
7. **Avoid AI Attribution**: Never include "Generated by Claude" or similar AI attribution in commits or PRs
8. **Professional Tone**: Write all content as if authored by the developer, not an AI assistant
